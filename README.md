# va_player
Audio/media player with voice assistant

1) Create musicbase.csv by scanm2.sh and tune_exif.py   (exiftool must installed, apt-get install exiftool)
2) Run playerservice/audio_service.py
3) Run tts_speak/tts_service.py
4) Run pipeline1/va_ver1.ipynb  to the last cell. Speak to microphone. Interrupt kernel for stop.

This is a demo program, to be honest, the recognition quality is still low enough to be really convenient to use.
